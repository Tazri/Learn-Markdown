in markdown language every simple text withour any syntax is paragraph.

if i wan to line break inside the paragraph in that case we use html br tag. Another thing markdown is super set of html. so thats why some html tag work in markdown language.

this is simple line. now it break by html br tag <br> And this is another line now break again <br><br> that time i break two time

if we want to alignment the paragraph in that case we use html p tag with align attribute.align attribute have 4 value. left,right,center and justify. by default this value is left.

lets see the example

<p align="right">
This is the paragraph from right align.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
This is the another paragraph with center align
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
This is another align with justify align. so it is justify and i saw this and thats way i increase this line.
</p>

if we write paragraph inside the block so in that case we use tab in first.

    This is pragraph inside the block.In that case we use the tab at the begining.
<br>
<h1 align="center">This is heading</h1>
